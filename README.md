For Day 6 of my 30 Days, 30 Projects challenge, I developed a File Organizer Tool using Python and CustomTkinter to create a clean, modern desktop automation utility.

The application allows users to select any directory and automatically organizes files into categorized subfolders such as Images, Videos, Documents, Audio, Archives, Code, and Others. File categorization is handled through extension-based mapping, ensuring structured and predictable organization.

A key focus of this project was transparency and user feedback. Instead of simply moving files silently, the application generates a detailed organization report that includes:

Total number of files processed

Category-wise distribution summary

Individual file movement logs

Clear execution status updates

This reporting mechanism improves user confidence and makes the tool feel complete and production-ready rather than just a basic script.

From a technical perspective, the project involved working extensively with Python’s os and shutil modules to safely handle file system operations. I also implemented real-time status updates within the GUI and designed a scrollable output console for detailed reporting. The interface was built using CustomTkinter to provide a modern dark-themed layout with improved usability and structure.

This project strengthened my skills in:

File system automation

Structured application logic

GUI development with CustomTkinter

Error handling and reporting

Designing tools with user experience in mind

The goal was not just automation, but building a practical and transparent desktop utility that solves a real-world productivity problem
